            Hello, I'm Josh, an aspiring Software Developer based in the United Kingdom. I am currently studying for a BSc in 
            Computer Science and I am in my final year. I currently work with the Python, Java/Kotlin and JavaScript programming
            languages and have interests in Artificial Intelligence, Web Development and Software Development and I am currently
            working on a handful of projects within these areas. I tend to keep to myself and work on my own projects, however,
            on occasion, you may also see me collaborate and assist other developers in their own endeavours.

            At the moment, I am working on a number of projects as part of my University coursework, however, I also have a couple of
            projects ideas that I may consider working on throughout 2024. If you would like to take a look at what I am currently working
            on, you can head over to my <a href="https://github.com/105hua">GitHub</a>. In addition to this, I also have a Modrinth account,
            where I host my Minecraft-related projects, which you can find <a href="https://modrinth.com/user/105hua_rinth">here</a>.
